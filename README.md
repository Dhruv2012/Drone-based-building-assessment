# Drone-based-building-assessment
### Project - "Identification of salient structuaral elements from buildings using UAVs"
The project aims to extract information such as planShape/Area, Storey and window count, their height and so on of the buildings from the camera feed through drone. It is a part of IHub - Mobility Research at IIIT Hyderabad.

#### Objectives of Pilot Study:
To identify salient structural elements in buildings from RGB images captured using a UAV.
1) Number of windows
2) Number of storeys
3) Storey height (Uniform/varied storey heights)
4) Building Plan estimation

#### Dataset:
We have made our own custom dataset by capturing buildings on IIIT-H campus through a drone. In addition, we have also used the open-source zju_facade dataset to train our models.

### Progress till now:
Please find our current progress in the following presentation.
